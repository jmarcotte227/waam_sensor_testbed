# Spectrometer Driver Notes
Omnidriver is still available in the archive here: https://www.oceanoptics.com/software/resources/discontinued-software/

I'm trying this with omnidriver 2.75

run the driver using the command 
python -m ocean_optics_spectrometer_robotraconteur_driver --spectrometer-info-file=HR4000CG_UV_NIR_spectrometer_default_config.yaml
